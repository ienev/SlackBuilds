Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each
player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the
ultimate goal: To become the greatest civilization.

Players of the Civilization(R) series by Microprose(R) should feel at
home, since one aim of Freeciv is to have optional modes (called rulesets)
with compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts,
and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out
there! That also means it has very extensive multilanguage support,
something rare in games.

Note: Building this on Slackware64, it complains about a missing mikmod
lib.  This is actually a little bug in Slackware64 that I reported
to Patrick.  The library is not needed at all, but the libSDL_mixer.la
file incorrectly states it as a dependency. On 32-bits Slackware this
does not happen.

This requires libmikmod to compile on Slackware64.
