eSvn is a QT GUI frontend to the Subversion revision system.

In addition to the the standard svn commands it features:
- svn repository browsing
- organizing working directories and workspaces
- showing changed items
- performing quick diff, external diff and 3-way diff
- showing the status of files/directories in real time

eSvn won't build on Slackware 13.0 without the Qt3 compatibility
package from /extra/kde3-compat.
